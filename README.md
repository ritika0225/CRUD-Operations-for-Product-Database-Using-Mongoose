# CRUD Operations for Product Database Using Mongoose\n\nThis project demonstrates how to implement basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a MongoDB collection using Mongoose in Node.js.\n\n## Features\n- Product model with name, price, and category fields\n- Express API with routes to add, list, update, and delete products\n- Basic validation and error handling using Mongoose\n\n## Setup\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `MONGODB_URI` to your MongoDB connection string\n3. Install dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n4. Start the server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## API endpoints\n- `GET /api/products` - list all products\n- `POST /api/products` - create a new product (body: `{ "name": "Product", "price": 10, "category": "Cat" }`)\n- `GET /api/products/:id` - get a product by ID\n- `PUT /api/products/:id` - update a product by ID (body: fields to update)\n- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - delete a product by ID\n\n## Notes\n- Schema validations are applied; invalid requests return 400 responses with validation messages.\n- Ensure MongoDB is running and reachable by the connection string in `.env`.\n
